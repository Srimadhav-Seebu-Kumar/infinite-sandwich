# Infinite Sandwich Generator

Absurdist, generative project that builds nonsense sandwiches from real and fictional ingredients, scored by models trained on random data. Streamlit UI, image gen, style LMs.

## Features

- **Random Sandwich Generation**: Creates unique combinations from fictional ingredients
- **AI Scoring System**: Mock ML models rate sandwiches on absurdity, creativity, and edibility  
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction
- **Sandwich History**: Track your generated sandwich creations
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment

## Installation
